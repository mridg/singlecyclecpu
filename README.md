### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) **Optional**
If you want you should install and use WSL so that we don't have to worry about cross compatibility stuff. You're going to want to learn how to use linux at some point anyway, so this is probably a low stakes way to get started. I've never used WSL but I can always help out with anything you need. 

https://github.com/microsoft/WSL

Use this link to get started and look at the README for the info to get it installed and set up 
You're going to have to learn some basic linux commands but lowkey just ask chatgpt to teach you as you go and you'll memorize the important ones as you go along. You're also going to have to get used to using git and github. 

BUT if you don't really want to there are ways to just use icarus on windows and I think this one is better than verilator for our purposes. 

### Git and Github
I think you can just ask chat if you need help to get started. That's definetly easier than me teaching you or going through some archaic guide. 
For our organization purposes NEVER commit to main unless both of us have agreed on it. You can do anything you want in the branch that has your name on it. NEVER touch my branch and I will never touch yours. This will just make sure that we don't run into merge conflicts, which is one of the most irritating issues to have to fix.

### Stanford Slides 
Go through these before you get started. It'll be a good review / overview of everything we're going to need to get this project going. 

### ECE362 Slides
These are the slides from my embedded systems class last semester. The slides aren't super descriptive, so I can explain them in more depth later. I'll probably go through them again myself so if I do, I'll add my own notes and commentary to this folder. I left my main notebook at school so I'm going to have to go through everything again :')
