### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) **Optional**
If you want you should use WSL so that we don't have to worry about cross compatibility stuff. You're going to want to learn how to use linux at some point anyway, so this is probably a low stakes way to get started. I've never used WSL but I can always help out with anything you need.

Use this link to get started and look at the README for the info to get it installed and set up 
You're going to have to learn some basic linux commands but lowkey just ask chatgpt to teach you as you go and you'll memorize the important ones as you go along. You're also going to have to get used to using git and github. 

BUT if you don't really want to there are ways to just use windows and it should be good enough for our purposes. 

### Git and Github
I think its easiest if you just ask chat if you need help with getting started (I imagine you alr know how to use git tho). 
For our organization purposes NEVER commit to main unless both of us have agreed on it. You can do anything you want in the branch that has your name on it. NEVER touch my branch and I will never touch yours. This will just make sure that we don't run into merge conflicts, which is one of the most irritating issues to have to fix. 

### Stanford Slides 
Go through these before you get started. It'll be a good overview / review of everything we're going to need to get this project going. 

### ECE362 Slides
These are the slides from my embedded systems class last semester. The slides aren't super descriptive, so I can explain them in more depth later. I'll add my own notes and commentary to this folder too. I left my notebook at school so I'm going to have to go through everything again anyway :')

### Icarus Verilog 
I went through a bunch of different options (verilator, quartus, etc) and I think icarus is probably the best for us. Verilator is a bit too much for what we want to do, and I don't want to install the software for Quartus LMAO.

Use this link to get started, make sure to scroll all the way down for windows installation instructions. I probably won't be able to help much with windows setup but I think it shouldn't be too bad... Hopefully
