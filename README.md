### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Aniket you should install and use WSL so that you don't have to partition your drives and mess up your computer and we don't have to worry about cross compatibility stuff.

Use this link to get started and look at the README for the info to get it installed and set up 
You're going to have to learn some basic linux commands but lowkey just ask chatgpt to teach you as you go and you'll memorize the important ones as you go along. You're also going to have to get used to using git and github. 

### Git and Github
I think you can just ask chat to help you get started its definetly easier than me teaching you or going through some archaic guide. 
For our organization purposes NEVER commit to main unless both of us have agreed on it. You can do anything you want in the branch that has your name on it. NEVER touch my branch and I will never touch yours. This will just make sure that we don't run into merge conflicts, which is one of the most irritating issues to have to fix.
